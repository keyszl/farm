**B. Team Procedures**

Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting?):
Who will set each agenda? How will team members be notified? - Catherine Mariza (sends out agenda the night before a meeting through Teams)
Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda? - Jonathon Qualls

Procedures in the absence of a team member: (will the team meet with one member absent, or must all members be present?): The majority of team members should be present during team meetings (at least three). However, if decisions are being made during a meeting, in which consensus is needed, the absent team member will be notified in teams. If two out of four people are not able to meet, the team will reschedule the meeting for later that week.

**C. Team Participation**

_Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:_

During team meetings, we will have check-ins based off of individual tasks to ensure that accountability is being upheld for task completion. We will also listen to each other's input on task load to ensure that each person is not overloaded or underloaded with their amount of tasks. In the case that a member is struggling, other members can swap tasks to help complete the task.

_Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members:_

Communicate with each other in and outside of meetings and have open conversations asking for input from each team member to ensure that all ideas are heard. Each team member will practice active listening in meetings to encourage other members to share their thoughts.

*Strategies for keeping on task:*

The team will utilize a shared calendar to schedule meetings, projected task completion dates, and other information as needed. The team will also use the issues function within GitHub to keep track of active and closed tasks. Meetings will act as check-ins to ensure that progress is being made in the different areas of the project.

**D. Personal Accountability**

*Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:*

Each team member is expected to show up on time to all team meetings. However, if a team member is not able to join the meeting/will be late to a meeting due to some other circumstance, said team member should notify the Teams group chat of their absence/tardiness. Each member is also expected to share their progress on individual tasks at the beginning of each meeting.

*Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:*

Each team member is expected to turn in all team assignments and tasks for the project by their deadlines. However, if a team member is not able to turn in an assignment on time, that should be communicated to the team as well as Dr. Goadrich prior to the deadline.

*Expected level of communication with other team members:*

Besides the team meetings twice a week, generally if a team member encounters a problem that requires extended help / advice from the team, that should be communicated to the team in a timely manner to avoid extra obstacles. Overall, the team should communicate with each other as necessary outside of the regular meeting times. Team members are also expected to communicate any issues that will not be resolved by deadlines or affect the team in some manner such as team meeting absence, task completion, etc.

*Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:*

Everyone should be aware of team decisions and tasks as they were decided by a unanimous consensus. This will allow us to avoid obstacles and conflict later on.

**E. Consequences of Breach of Contract**

*Policies for handling infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:*

Case by case, any one infraction will be discussed among the team. The team member who has breached the contract in any way will discuss the event with the rest of the team to ensure that the infraction will not happen again.

*Policies for handling persistent infractions:*

Set up a meeting with Dr. Goadrich to discuss persistent infraction.
